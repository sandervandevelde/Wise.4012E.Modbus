# Introduction
This is a C# library for accessing the [Advantech Wise 4012E](http://www.advantech.com/products/4260f153-57cd-4102-81ea-7a0f36d9b216/wise-4012e/mod_4e936d58-a559-4c1a-9022-e96698c2930b?_ga=1.82474646.1033186900.1491183171) 

This library gives access to the two Knobs (read), the two Switches (read) and the two Relays (write).

I reference the Modbus Nuget package called [NModbus](https://github.com/NModbus/NModbus).
